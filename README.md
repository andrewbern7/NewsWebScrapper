# NewsWebScrapper
A web scraper that pulls all displayed articles on the "US-News" page of NBC. Working to make it universal across major new websites. Once implemented, I would like to add a summarizer feature to condense dozens of articles from different publishers into a 10 minute read. This is my first GitHub repo and advice is welcomed!
